# NannyMUD


## Overview
NannyMUD is a text-based adventure game I've been playing on and off since ~ 1993. I love reading, programming, and in automation/bots - all of which are involved in playing MUDs. I started playing NannyMUD when I was about 15 and I've played it off and on since (over 20 years now). It's one of the longest running games in history. Back in the day, there was a huge player base and it was common to log on and play with 30+ players at the same time. Unfortunately it's mostly dead now and on a good day, there are 5+ players logged in.

I originally played with a simple, non-programmable telnet client (the beauty of muds!) - but later switched to Zmud, then CMUD, and finally TinTin++. As a side-project, I've *slowly* been working on a pure-python programmable mud client with multi-window support. In the meantime though, I still use TinTin++ as my mud client along with a set of custom built python extensions.

The NannyMUD section of this wiki contains lots of information that technically *should not* be shared, however since NannyMUD is mostly dead at this point, I've chosen to publish it - but mostly for historical reference (as there really aren't many people around any longer who care).

NannyMUD Player Days
--------------------
Every so often, a "NannyMUD player day" is scheduled on the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nannymud/) - and *lots* of players will log in to play at the same time. Very *nostalgic*. Monitor the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nannymud) to see when these are scheduled.
