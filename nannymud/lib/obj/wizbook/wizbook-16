                   TOURIST INFORMATION

In the tourist information you cam borrow small booklets about 
wizards. All wizards that have an open area really should have a 
booklet there. It is easy to make, just make the directory
'/open/info/<my_name>' 


You want people to come to your area? You always get questions 
from people asking you where your area is located? Then you should
consider writing about it in the tourist office and this is the text 
telling you how. When this is done, you just have to 
write the information file(s) and put them in that directory. The
filename of the file is the name that gets listed in the index of
the booklet and those should also be lowercase, or it won't work. If 
you want space in the name, save as 'my_area' for example. 

In here you can write everything you think that players want to know.
Of course it should have something to do with the mud. A little hint is
to not write exact directions as "To reach my area go w, s, w ...". Try 
do use nice descriptions as "Go to the humpbacked bridge and etc". This is
mainly to make people explore and not just follow scripts. Have fun!
