                       APPROVAL

A lot of things needs approval before you may open it to mortals.
To get something approved talk to someone with level 23 or higher,
or put a note on the approval board (u, w, w from the normal
wizardboard). 

When someone says that it is approved, make sure that he/she has 
written about it in the directory /permissions in the file 
<your name>.per. If it isn't in that file, it isn't approved.

Also read /permissions/APPROVE to see who you should talk
with about very special things, like quests, guilds etc.
