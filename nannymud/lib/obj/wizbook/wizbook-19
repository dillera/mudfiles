	               MOVE_OBJECT VS TRANSFER

Both move_objject and transfer are used for moving things,
so what is the difference?

Well, basicly the difference is that transfer adjusts weight
and move_object doesn't.

So when moving things in or out of players you have to use
transfer, because otherwise the player will not get any
weight from the object and there will be a weightbug.

When moving things to room, you can use move_object, but
you can also use transfer. It will not make any difference
because rooms don't care about weight.
