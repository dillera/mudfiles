			  CREATION OF ARMOUR

A couple of things about armour. The building rules have a list of
acceptable types and classes. Have a further look in
/doc/RULES/armour.r  Any exceptions from these values should be 
granted permission.
Also read /doc/build/armour to see how to you make an armour.

We really, REALLY discourage setting anything other than armour higher
than 3.  It's not that any one piece of armour will be too
dangerous... think of a mortal with one of everything with class 6, and
class 21 armour. That makes a grand total of class 63!

NOTA BENE: /doc/build/armour is an old document, but noone has had
the time to write a new document. So when you want to build an armour
first look on the armour in the examplerooms and read
/doc/std/simple_armour.doc
