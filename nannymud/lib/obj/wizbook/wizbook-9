			 CREATION OF MONSTERS
	      AND HOW THEY RELATE TO WEAPONS AND ARMOUR

One of the toughest things to work out as a new wizard is how tough a
monster should wield how tough a weapon. The end result of this
question is: How much trouble should I give a mortal before he/she/it can
get this weapon?

There's no one answer to this. It's worth it just to cruise the mud
and see what the going rate is. Take a look at a bunch of monsters
and see about how tough a monster wields the strength weapon you've
created. Be careful, though, since wizard has used the 'stat' command to
cheat with thier seconds, this is probably logged. Some limits cab also be
found in /doc/RULES/monster.r

When it comes to really creating the monster you should read 
/doc/build/monster.

NOTA BENE: /doc/build/monster is an old document, but noone has had
the time to write a new document. So when you want to build a monster
first look on the monsters in the examplerooms and read the files
/doc/std/basic_monster.doc and /doc/std/simple_monster.doc .
