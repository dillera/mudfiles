	       WIZARDS, A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES

When you were playing the mud as a mortal it was fun. You liked to go
in, kill things, get drunk, party, and generally have fun. That's the
whole point of a MUD: to have fun. So your job NOW as a contributing
wizard on this MUD is to make it fun for the mortals.

The primary job of a wizard is to build an area. This is a large
collection of rooms, monsters, and treasures... but you know all that
from your days as a mortal. Just kick back, recall your times as a
mortal, and remember what intrigued you, what made you want to kill a
particular monster, and what made you want to run a particular maze.
That's the kind of thing you want in your castle. But better... :-)

You have to read /doc/RULES before you build anything!

If you have never before experienced LPC then you really should
read through the /doc. It's all there, and if you still have questions
ask other wizards or the high wizards, they are there to help you.
If possible you should always try to ask your sponsor first, it is
his/her responsibility to help you learn how to be a wizard.
