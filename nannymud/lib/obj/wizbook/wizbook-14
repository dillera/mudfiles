			HISTORY

NannyMUD is an LPmud. That means that the driver is of the same type
as the one Lars Pensj| at Chalmers in Gothenburg first wrote. It
is an interpretor for a C-like language called LPC.

The first LPmud started in April 1989 and it was called Genesis.
In May 1989 was a mud started at Lysator. This mud became NannyMud.
This is the oldest mud which still has the original mudlib
and some of the original wizards are still active.
