		       CREATION OF MAGIC ITEMS

In the course of creating your castle you will undoubtedly be sitting
somewhere at some time and have a little lightbulb pop up over your
head, and exclaim, "What a COOL idea for a magic item!!"  At this time
you should sit down and think over your cool idea and make sure that
it will be cool after 10 mortals have used it to lay waste to all the
"tough monsters" in your castle:

    1 - All magic items that give mortals tremendous powers (like
	teleporting), should be charged items, and should expire after
	a small, preset number of uses. A GREAT DEAL of testing
	should be done on these objects to make sure they can't be
	abused.

    2 - Any superobjects or wizard tools, should ABSOLUTELY BE
	RESTRICTED TO WIZARD USE. If a mortal has an object that can
	set the level of another mortal, or that can create money, or
	that can do ANYTHING a wizard can do, all hell will break
	loose. Set something in the object so only wizards or only
	you can use it.
