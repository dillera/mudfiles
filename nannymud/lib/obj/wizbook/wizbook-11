				QUESTS

Quests are a way to get mortals to explore the mud.  This is a good
thing while they are mortals, and is a good thing prior to their
becoming wizard. This exposes them to the efforts of other wizards,
and gives them a chance to see the overall style of the mud before
creating a castle.

A couple of points to keep in mind when creating quests:

    1 - Post your quest idea on the project board for review.  This does 
        a couple of things. First, it lets others see your quest,
	second we've been experimenting with "chained" quests, where
	one quest can only be completed through the completion of
	another one, or possibly both at the same time.

    2 - Quest objects should be intangible, or at least unable to be
	given or traded between mortals. The point of a quest is to
	encourage the mortals to explore the mud, not to make them
	good little capitalists.

    3 - If you can, try and cross-quest with other wizards. An
	example of this would be for the completion of one quest to
	result in getting the hint for another quest, or something of
	that sort.

    4 - You have to add some random in the quest. Then it will not be
        so easy to make a robot solving the quest.

And before finally adding a quest to the game you must have it
approved by the quest coordinator. More info can be found in
