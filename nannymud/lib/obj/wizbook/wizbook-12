			GUILDS

 If you wish to make a guild of your own then please first consult
/doc/build/RULES/guilds.r and also have a look in the /guilds/DOC/ for any
files starting with GUILD_, maybe someone has already made that particular
guild.

NOTA BENA:
Due to some cheating wizards you can no longer read /guilds/DOC hopefully
this will change in the future.
