			 CREATION OF WEAPONS

As a mortal you would have KILLED for a weapon class 20 sword.
Well... You DID kill for most every sword you got. :) Super powerful
weapons are bad news as a wizard, though.  They mean that a mortal can
go on a slay ride through your castle and kill all of your "tough"
monsters.

We've had a lot of problems with very powerful weapons. For this
reason we've put restrictions on how powerful weapons can be. For the
most part, weapons shouldn't be over WC 15.  Weapon Class 20 weapons
should only be for very special cases, and should be restricted in
some way.  An example would be a "slayer" weapon that is WC 10 or so
for most things, but is WC 20 for the kind of beast it will slay.

If you want your monster to be really tough, but fear that would mean
making a tremendously powerful weapon, remember that your monster can
be carrying a WC 12 weapon, but still attack with WC 25. The mortal
will never know.

In /doc/build/weapon you can read about how to make a weapon,
and in /doc/RULES/weapon.r you can read about how good you
may make them.
NOTA BENE: /doc/build/weapon is an old document, but noone has had
the time to write a new document. So when you want to build a weapon
first look on the weapons in the examplerooms and read
/doc/std/simple_weapon.doc
