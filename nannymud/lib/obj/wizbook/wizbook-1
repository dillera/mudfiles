			 THE WIZARD GUIDE BOOK

	   Stolen from Harper@NLD-mud and modified by Pell
                     modified even more by Anna

Many of the commands explained in this book require a shell.
If you don't have any do 'clone /local/brainloader'.

This book is currently being rewritten. That's why there is
a strange order of the pages.
If you have any ideas about this book mail me.
