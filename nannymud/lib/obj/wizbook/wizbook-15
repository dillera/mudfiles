               HOW DOES ACL RIGHTS WORK

ACL stands for Access Control List, and is a way to control
what access a given LPC object or wizard can have to filesystem
objects like directories and files.

The following access rights are defined:

	P	Protect, can modify ACLs
	D	Delete, can delete filesystem objects
	A	Add, can create filesystem objects
	L	List, can get a directory listing
	U	Use, (not currently implemented)
	R	Read, can read files
	W	Write, can write to already existing files
	X	eXecute, can clone&load objects (not yet implemented)

Two abbreviations also exists, ALL is all the above rights, and NONE
is none of the above rights.

To give access to someone in a directory you must have the P right
yourself. The you write:
edac <dir> <name>:<right>
If I for example wants to give LURX (Normal access) to Rohan in my
directory, and I am in my directory I just write:
edac . rohan:LURX

to see what rights there are in a directory, just type 'lac'
(list access control).
