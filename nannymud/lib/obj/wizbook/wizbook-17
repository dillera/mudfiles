	       HOW DO I BECOME LEVEL 21

To become level 21 you have probably noted that if
you go to Leo you will get this book and a form.
This book is to make it easier for you to find out all
the rules and a little about other things that are
useful to know.

The form has some questions that has to be answered to be able
to become level 21. The form is not autoloading and if you loose it
you can go to Leo to get a new one, with the same questions. 
After the questions have been filled in try to get someone who 
is willing to become your sponsor.
He/She will teach you all the things that you want to know
and that isn't in this book.
When you have found your sponsor and he/she has signed the form,
go with it to someone with level >=23. He/She will then, if
he/she thinks that you have answered the questions correctly,
validate the form. When the form is validated the answers cannot
be changed.
When you give the validated form to Leo you will become level 21.

When you become level 21 you will get your own workroom, and your own
directory to put your own files in. You will also get a castle. The
castle is used when you have made your own area and want to
connect it to the rest of the world. You will also get a lot of new
commands. Some of them are explained here in this book.
