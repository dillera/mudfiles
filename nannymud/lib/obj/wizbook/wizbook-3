		      WIZARD/MORTAL INTERACTIONS

As a wizard you are given certain powers. With these come certain
responsibilities. Use your power wisely. Don't abuse them.  Some of
the big abuses that have recently cropped up (and ones you, as a
responsible wizard, should NEVER do) are:

    1 - Do not kill mortals (other than by having tough monsters in
	your castle) This will chase them off, and tick off the other
	wizards.

    2 - Do not play excessive practical jokes on mortals, or unduly
	annoy them by your actions. This mud is for the mortals.

    3 - Do not force mortals or wizards to do anything. The force
	command is there to cover your tracks after a bug. Forcing a
	mortal to return an object s/he should not have is one
	thing...  Forcing a mortal or wizard to do things for kicks is
	another thing altogether.

    4 - Do not un-wimp mortals. This is potentially deadly,
	especially if the mortal is busy killing (or being killed) by
	something.

    5 - Do not heal mortals, REGARDLESS of how much they whine that
	they were hurt by big, scary monsters.

    6 - Do not give mortals money or experience. Having the game
	given to you on a silver platter is not fun. At times as a
	mortal you might have wished for that, but...

    7 - Do not use excessive shouts or echoalls. These are not only
	annoying to mortals, but if any wizards are editing they are
	likely to kill you.
