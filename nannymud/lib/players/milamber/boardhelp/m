--------------- Movement -----------------
There are several ways to view a note. The
most basic one is to simply type a number.
This will move you the the note mentioned.
There are also the keys n, p and g. n will
obviously move you to the next note in the
chain of comments, p will move you the the
previous one. g num will do the same thing
as just num. g num will also set the comment
chain to all comments to note num.
Return is an alias for n.

Example: Imagine the following chain of comments:
0: This is a test-board (Milamber Fri Jun 17 )
 9: Yes, it is. (Milamber Fri Jun 17 )  (0) <10 and 12>
  10: Yes, it sure is. (Milamber Fri Jun 17 )  (9) <>
  12: Hmm... (Milamber Fri Jun 17 ) (9) <>
 11: This is a new note... (Milamber Fri Jun 17 ) (0) <>

Starting with note 0, and typing return, you would
get to read note 9,10,12 and 11, in that order.
