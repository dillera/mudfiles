                    Writing mode                    
-------------------------------------------------------
Well, to write a new note, use the 'N' command. It will
pop up a request for a 'Header'. This is what's visible
when you use the 'h' comand (A 'headline'). It _should_
have some sort of connection to the actual note.       
Then, you should write the actual note. This needs some
reehacking from my side, but it is quite alike the mode
used in all other bulletin boards on the mud.          
There are one major difference: When you press linefeed
to begin a new line, the board won't display it to the
reader, It will try to format all text. You can force a
linefeed by pressing return twice. /Milamber
