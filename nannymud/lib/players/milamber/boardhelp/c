Creating a new board
--------------------

Nothing could be easier than creating a new board.
(If you are a wizard, that is. At the moment players are not allowed
 to create new boards, due to policy reasons)

1> Type 'boards join <your new board>', <your new board> beeing the name
   of the new board, e.g. 'books'
2> Enter the board, using 'boards <shortest unique string>', eg 'boards bo'
3> Edit note number 0, using 'E 0'. This will set you to the owner of
   the board, and set the creation date. The title will be the title
   of the board, and the body the description of the board.
4> If you want any protection level, set it using the 'P' command.
   0 - Anyone may read
   1 - All but guest may read
   {level} - level {level} and up may read
   {item} - anyone carrying something with an id matching {item} may read.
            {item} may not start with a number
