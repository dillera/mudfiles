                Removing texts.
-------------------------------------------------
 Well, when you remove a text, I can't simply
 erase it, other texts may have links to it.
 therefore, i simply mark it 'deleted' and remove
 all data associated with it.
 To remove a text, type 'D <number>', where
 <number> is it's number.
