Hallo all my friends (and enemies..).I know that it's hard to beleive ,
but I am leavin' the University of Essen and goin' back to Greece (and from
there back to Australia...) and I want to say a very very WARM bye-bye to all
people here who helped me (most of them Helenette,Bobbo,Charmangle,Plaque and
if I've forgot someone forgive me...).
I want to congratulate for their very nice quests (even if I haven't solved 
half of them) Banshee,Padrone,Brom and Guildmaster (for my unknown review).
I also want to say that I hate that that that ***** wizard called Sal cause
he zapped me in real life ,I want to say sorry to Flynn for killing me...(!)
I hope that Holland won't be qualified in the World cup in USA so that guy  
(Bruce) won't be happy ,I hope Sweden will be qualified there so most people 
in this MUD will be happy and I hope that my beloved soccer team (FC Bayern
Munchen) will win the German champion & cup and the European cup next year.

Lothar Matthaus vom FC Bayern.

P.S. I'm leaving cause I won't have a computer area where I'm goin'...
