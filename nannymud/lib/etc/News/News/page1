 _____/\/\_____ The Global Pages _____/\/\_____

  Welcome to the New NannyMUD Times, now a much
 bigger and hopefully better newspaper here on
 NannyMUD. The new features of this newspaper 
 is a possibility for interested wizards to
 have their own pages, and being able to update
 them on their own. This way we hope to see a 
 much more "live" paper than the old one. 
 Interested wizards can talk to or mail Anvil.
 He will fill you in on all the details on how
 to start writing pages. For mortals the new
 features is that you will be able to write
 ads, announcements, personals and comics to
 the paper. The new stuff supplied will be
 added to the paper moderately quick, probably
 within two hours. To write something in the
 paper you need only locate a stand labelled
 "NannyMUD Times".
