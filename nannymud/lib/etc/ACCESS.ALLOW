# o A class is defined the first time it's used
# o The maximum-value is only used at a class-definition. If its -1, no maximum
#   is installed. If it's 0, logins from this class are disabled.
# o string is sent, if the login can't be allowed. on classes with maximum=0, 
#   this should be a general message, that no logins are allowed from this 
#   class, if maximum is some number, it should say something like 
#   "maxmium users from your site class exceeded".
# Order MATTERS. IE if you allow 129.*.*.*, you have to put any restrictions 
# on 129.132.*.* BEFORE this statement.
# Addresses not matching any patterns are not allowed. 
# (You can get rid of this default by allowing *.*.*.* as the last rule).

# CALL-1A0 has access limited to some maximum, for now 5 logins. Class 2
