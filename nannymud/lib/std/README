This directory is should only contain generic, configurable items
or items that are commonly used in other ways than cloning / 
inhereriting. (such as /std/lib) Objects meant for direct cloning,
without configuration should be placed in /std/items. Objects placed
in /std/rfc should not be used, they are merely there so that people
can check them out and give their remarcs about what is bad and what
is good. Objects in /std/rfc will in most cases be moved to somewhere
in /std/ after a while. Documentation to files in this directory can
be found in /doc/std/.
