Guilds
======


Overview
--------
Guild's are the primary unit of 'organizations' in NannyMUD. The guild to which you belong determines your abilities, spells, and powers. Guilds typically come with various drawbacks to compensate for the abilities that they provide - the more powerful the abilities, the more extreme the drawbacks.


The Adventurers' Guild
----------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: The Adventurer's guild is the guild that every player starts out in. It has relatively few abilities, and most players are expected to leave it by level 10.


Chef's Guild
-----------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: The Chefs advance their cooking prowess by finding new types of monsters to cook throughout the world.


Cult of Cthulhu
---------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: This guild worships Cthulhu. Beware. Only those of evil minds can comprehend Cthulhu.


Darks
-----
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: A secretive order. Darks are always found in the dark, carrying black candles to cast out any light. This guild is ideal for experienced players that wish to play an evil character. The alignment restrictions are quite strict, and a Darks' power increases with a more evil alignment.


The Druids Guild
----------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: This is a good guild for beginners. It focuses on powers of nature, and has no alignment restrictions.


Champions of Khorne
-------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Followers of Khorne may never die, or they will be removed from the guild. There is no excuse for defeat, victory requires none. In order to advance in this guild, one must constantly be killing, or Khorne will be displeased. Magic and cowardice are not tolerated, and players must therefore rely on melee combat and their own wits in battle.

The Assembly of Knights
-----------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: The opposite of Darks, this guild requires a good alignment. A Knight must never party or help a Dark, and must always help the side of good. Knights are well known for being helpful to new and old players alike. This guild often requires one to defend Camelot, for evil often attacks the castle. Knights are often required to show a lot of virtues: courage, kindness, politeness and the list can go on forever. Some restriction have been made with the help of the game to give young squires challenges to accomplish in crafting their true knight spirit. Being a "true" knight goes way beyond the boundaries of Camelot or even NannyMud. Being a "true" knight here you will most probably be a "true" knight forever, no matter where the real life carries you.


Lepers Guild
------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: Those cast out of the normal world for their disgusting disease, the lepers often live in recluse with one another.  Abilities and status in the guild are linked to the severity of disease. Higher level lepers may obtain strong powers, but will also discover side effects as a result of their advanced leprosy, including slight harm to party members in close proximity, as well as increased skin sensitivity and the inability to wear certain items. Their equipment is tainted, so once a leper uses it only other lepers may equip it Although, it is said that unique equipments are imbued with magic that can resist the leprosy. The Leper Colony is a safe haven for lepers to recover their health.  Potential people that want to join the colony may ask a leper to pass the disease.


The Masters of NannyMUD
-----------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: For the truly talented that wish to have a challenge. Only experienced players should join this guild.  A real Master completely ignores the person that plays it.  The Holy Monks Order    | The Monks Guild is one of the oldest guilds on Nanny, initially created by Ingis in the fall of 1990. For years it was inactive, with few or no members, until being revived with new powers in the mid 90s. A guild for experienced players. Advancement in this guild requires questpoints.  Monks are able to heal and fight with their fists. They must attend masses in the monastery chapel.


The Hunters Guild
-----------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: The Hunters Guild was created by the wizard Vincent. As new lands are discovered, adventurous people seek out these new frontiers to find their fortunes. These hardy individuals bring little with them but their skills. They learn to kill the animals in the environment, skin them and sell the pelts/skins for profit. They can make most the things they need from available materials. These hunters live by their wits and skills. Unskilled hunters struggle to survive, but skilled hunters can make use of wood and parts from animals that they kill. As they learn the ways of the native wildlife, even the strongest creatures can be defeated. The guild was closed after players and Vincent lost interest when the guild was rebalanced. In 2009, the wizard Astrodeath reopened the guild.  


The Prophets
------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: This guild is all about predicting what will happen next. As you progress through the guild, you will learn about abilities and drawbacks and how you can use them to your advantage. Some of the more interesting abilities include: predicting future events, channeling dead spirits to hear of their fate, peeking into other rooms without entering, asking the stars about detailed information on objects, watching other players and monsters from a distance, seeing the precise route to something or someone, the famous warlock wheel. The end is near... or so the prophets say.  This guild is good for beginners, as advancement in it is fairly straightforward.


Simyarin
--------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: A difficult guild to advance in, but essentially what one would call a mages guild. These mages use magic to decimate their foes.

Vampires
--------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: The vampires are the most secretive guild of NannyMud. Nobody knows when they first arrived, but they have silently spread around. especially amongst adventurers. Vampires are said to be immortals, as you can never see them hurt, though some high ranked Khornes seem to think otherwise. Nobody knows the exact nature of their powers, but playerkillers from other guilds have always spoken with great fear or respect about them. It was said that they can pick up your track with great ease, sneak up on you without notice and kill you almost instantly. One has never seen a vampire visit pubs or restaurants. It is said that they feed on blood. If that is true, than perhaps the rumours of constant killing for greater power amongst the kindred could also be true.


The Vikings Guild
-----------------
Location: N/A
Status: Active
Description: Vikings. They worship the Norse gods.


The Chaos Guild
---------------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Location: N/A
Description: Mostly a joke guild from 1991, which offered an unbalancing "explode head" spell that did nearly 200 points of damage.


The Damned
----------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: A guild started by Ramses in 1993, which initially was substantially identical to Ged's Mage Guild--Ramses took the mage guild object and just changed the strings, powers and emotive commands to reflect his new guild concept.


The Doomed
----------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: Not to be confused with the Damned above, the Doomed was a very early guild from the first days of the mud (it is present in the famous May 1990 backup of the mud, which has occasionally been brought online during anniversary times).  The only power was the ability to "send" objects to other players, using a giant magic crow, at a cost of 15 spell points. A lack of checks on the item in question made it a useful way to get rid of curses and diseases that relied on being an inventory object held by the player.


The Drunks
----------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: N/A


The Guild of Musicians
----------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
This early guild was created by Beatmaster, who left shortly after its creation. Members received a spellbook which could hold custom spells, several of which were severely unbalanced. The difficulty in finding the guild reduced the number of members.


The Kittens
-----------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: The most innovative and fun Guild Nanny ever saw was the Kittens. Unfortunately the creator and the administration had different opinions about which was fair and not and it resulted in the Guild being closed - never to open again.


League of Agnostics
-------------------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: A guild created by Badman in 1991, mostly as an in-mud chat room. The only offensive power offered by the guild object was "debate", which did (level+1)*2 damage to non-player priests and monks only.  


The Mages
---------
Location: N/A
Status: Inactive
Description: The most popular of the early guilds, created by Ged in 1991/1992, and later taken over by Ppannion.
