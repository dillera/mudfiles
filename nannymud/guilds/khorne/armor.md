Armor
=====
Chaos armour is the term for all armour given by Khorne to his Champions. The Armour is a living entity and forms after the transformed body of the Champion. Notable is that this armour is permanent and can not be dropped. As you might have heard the armour is given to you when you advance rank within the guild. 

The armour given to you is randomly determined.

The different types of armour are:

Skin, your skin gets tougher.
black → red → brazen

Chaos Helmet, your head turns bulkier and tougher. 
→ brazen → 

Chaos Platemail, your torso transforms.
→ brazen → golden?

Chaos Boots, your feet transform.
→ brazen → 

Chaos Gloves, your hands transform. 
→ brazen →
