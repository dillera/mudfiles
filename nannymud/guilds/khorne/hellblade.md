Hellblade
=========
The Hellblade is a powerful weapon that only Champions of Khorne can have. It hungers for kills and grows in strength when you kill. The sword can always be retrieved in the Weaponary, you also return it there when you don't want to use it any more. 

There are a few commands that will help you in this task. 

Remember kills must be made while the Hellblade is wielded and performed by you, ie. you must deliver the killing stroke. 
htoggle — Show whether the kill was approved or not.
kills — Shows if the Hellblade is wielded or not, and the number of kills made.
wield — Wields the Hellblade.
unwield — Unwields the Hellblade.
hbreak — Destroys your Hellblade and unleashes a Bloodthirster to help you in your fight. Thus this must be done in a fight, you loose your Hellblade until you are rewarded one again.
