Clubs
=====


Overview
--------
Clubs are like 'mini-guilds'. They're *mostly* a "gimmick" (they don't provide anything that make you more powerful).  Clubs typically provide additional *emotes*, and *channels*, and a few provide *mini-games*. Some of these are very easy to find, but some are difficult. I haven't found them all yet.

Status: N/A
Description: Advance in the club by successfully defeating monsters (or other players) in the game. Gain recognition amongst your peers for vanquishing particularly powerful foes. This is a club for fighters, mostly against monsters. If one chooses to hunt players, then they should try the Pk Club, as slaying mainly players won't get them to advance much in this club. The toughest the monster you're slaying, the more points you will gain. But be careful, dying does not come cheap either in this club!
