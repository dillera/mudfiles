3.1.0

From now on, I (lars@cd.chalmers.se) will not develop new major features. I
will only use minimum time to fix bugs. The goal is to make the game driver as
bug free and stable as possible. I will not either incorporate new big
features from others, as that has proven to require much time from me.

Fixed a bug in the initialization code, which did become a recursive
function call.

The statment catch(exec(...)) could crash the game.

3.1.1

Fixed a severe bug, where this_player() returned non-zero value when the
object was destructed. The basic idea is that it should never be possible
to refer to a destructed object.

'nomask' functions and variables wasn't checked for correctly. 'private'
functions were fixed, so that they can no be called through call_other().

This is a short summary of how special types are handled:

    'static' variables: Will not be saved at save_object(), nor modified at
    restore_object(). 'static' functions can not be called through
    call_other(). 'static' inheritance will make all inherited definitions
    'static'.

    'private' variables and functions: Can not be accessed by a sub class
    'public' variables and functions can be redefined by a sub class, even if
    they have been inherited 'private'ly. 'public' inheritance will make all
    inherited definitions 'public'. 

    The type 'protected' is reserved, but does not mean anything currently.
