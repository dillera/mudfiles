Yours gives you information about Ward against Uin:
The ward magic was developed by the ancient dwarf legend D'aruk Khan. He was one of the first of the powerful Sorcerers to join Simyar-Lome. With him he brought the heritage of Dwarven magic, runes. A ward is simply a protective rune against a certain monster or foe. The wards comes in different types, with different names.

This is a small dictionary for Silaan to English:

Ain == Male Uin == Female Nain == Neuter Azog == Evil Nulb == Good Esg == Neutral

Adhiar == Rat/mouse Azgaz == Ogre Azguz == Troll Crantur == Daemon/Demon Cromo == Wolf Dhair == Giant Dori == King Eadig == Elfs Manduri == Guard Saru == Orcs Suldo == Knight/Paladin Taflin == Rabbit Qduz == Goblin Quzin == Kobold Wym == Dragons

Took gives you information about Leg Power:

The spell makes the player walk one extra step at times. Syntax: enchant <player> leg power.
