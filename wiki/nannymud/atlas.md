Overview
--------
NannyMUD is absolutely *HUGE*. I've played on and off for 20+ years now, and still find new things constantly. The NannyMUD world is divided into separate continents divided by non-navigatable barriers (oceans). To traverse between continents, travel systems are provided (in general these are ships, though there are also portals, and a blimp and various guild-specific mechanisms).

Note: By non-navigatable, I mean that they take time to move from one location to another - you can't simply 'walk' through them. Typically you do something like enter a ship, tell it to set sail to a destination, then wait for a queue and exit at the new location. This makes scripting movement between continents very difficult.

Each continent is composed of various realms. Realms are a collection or themed group of areas/rooms, typically written by one (but sometimes collaborated by multiple) wizards.


Maps
----
Malan generated some graphical maps of several areas (a long time ago) that are still up and available:

- [Malan's NannyMUD Maps: Primary](http://mfoster.com/misc/nannymud_maps.php) ([cached](/resources/maps/malan-primary.html))
- [Malan's NannyMud Maps: Mainland](http://crm.blaah.net/nanny/mainland.html) ([cached](/resources/maps/malan-mainland.html))
- [Malan's NannyMud Maps: Antharis](http://crm.blaah.net/nanny/antharis.html) ([cached](/resources/maps/malan-antharis.html))


Continents
----------
NannyMUD is divided into several 'continents'. Generally, this means that some method of transportation is necessary to get from one area to another - a boat, a blimp, a portal, or a spell.

The continents I know about are:

- Mainland 
- East Coast
- West Coast
- South Coast
- Antharis

### Alexii
Directions: 5e, s+
Description: The realm of Alexii is situated on the coast east of the village and slightly to the south along the shore from the jetty.  Alexii is one of the oldest and still active wizards this mud has, and is known as the fair lady of light. Her mansion is a small and modest place where she contemplates the world in peace. Her dinners, which her french cook serves, are renowned. The mansion itself is surrounded by a white wall of marble and not open to the public, but there is a small and peaceful garden at the east side, with a skillful gardener who tends to it and has herbs as a side interest. If you would like to visit, just follow the village road to the jetty, and follow the beach south.

A great forest is spoken of, whose secrets are hidden well, but there for those who take the time to truly know the area.  To find this path, follow the western road through the mountain pass.  There you will find the trail, follow it northward to see what secrets await you.  A word to explorers: In order to be successful in our area, hearty use of 'examine' is in order." Gallon.

Description: The Light Leaf forest surrounding the city of Lawrence is a large wooded area with many interesting features. There is much to be found for the curious adventurer. Beware of the thieves. They will try to steal what they can. And they can be very nasty when found in groups.  Lawrence is a small peaceful community on the shore of the Sunblood sea on Antharis. You will find peaceful people and some interesting shops. The castle and keep in the center of the city have been known to hold great treasure. Of course it could be heavily guarded.  There are a few puzzles and many interesting items in the town. Make sure to check out the clubs. You may find one worth joining.  

### Banshee
Directions: 4e,s+
Description: The Realm of Banshee is situated between the village road and the south sea. You can enter it by following the path leading south from the village shore. At the entrance you can find a board of information that has been put up there to help you find what you are looking for. If you decide to go there, beware of the gnats that usually are inhabitating the foggy meadow. A connection has recently been opened from the path leading around the Castle of Alexii, and you can reach the southern parts of Banshee's realm either by following the east coast of the mainland, or enter from the south coast in Ingis area. There is also suppposed to be a secret tunnel leading  under the Sea of Claws from Banshee's area and Brom's Island.  There are several sub-realms containing eight quests and everything from vampires and dinosaurs to nuns and kittens. The realm is rather large, over 500 rooms in fact, so there are many things for you to explore. Banshee is eager to keep her realm in a perfect condition, so if you find any bugs or typos or just have ideas about how to improve things, let her know.

### Brom
Directions: East.
Description: The land over which Brom holds absolute dominion is named Bromordia, and is generally called a 'duchy', even though there's really no king whom Brom call his liege lord. This hasn't stopped Brom from appointing himself Grand Duke.   You can find the realm of Brom if you go south from the village church, and then keep going east. After some steps you'll have crossed the sea, and where the dry land starts, so does Bromordia. Naturally, you might find Brom's castle here, and if you are lucky, Brom himself. That is, however, the least of the monsters you can encounter; they abound. So do items of various kind, many of them very powerful. Power doesn't come easy, though.  There are parts of Bromordia that are seldom, if ever visited by anyone; it has happened that years has passed between the appearance of some parts and the first visit to them. There's certainly more than meet the eye of the casual explorer. There's a band of rogues in Bromordia, mainly terrorising the westlands.  The road going from Brom's castle to Larstown is patrolled by guards, but even so, it happens that unlucky travellers get robbed on it. In order to get the money back, they have to find the robbers hide-out and the treasury. Rumours tell about untold riches there; it might be worth your while even if you haven't been robbed yourself ...

Description: A man reported discovering an entrance to a Dwarven city deep within the caves north of Elm Road, beyond the village and forest, up the mountains north of Sandon Village.  He spoke of a gate set into the gaping mouth of a demon's head.  Whether or not these are the ramblings of an insane man or if the hidden city actually exists is not known.  Following is an excerpt from the man's diary: ""...and there beyond Demon's Gate, I saw it: the Dwarven city, undiscovered for centuries, unknown to the outside world.  The hallways are covered with black galvorn plates, torches hang from the walls, giving light to otherwise complete darkness.  Further in, I saw a remarkable building, the Highseat of Ghan-Toth, the royal palace...

Description: A land of dark forests, cold, frozen lands and sharp mountain peaks, my domain can be found only a short distance west from the Orc Valley, which in turn lies west of the village. There is a sign; follow it, and you have found what you sought. Those are strange lands... Wild beasts roam there, silent hills stand on long-forgotten fields of battle, and the tall peaks of Tor Androg are never far away. Countless things are hidden, some have lain unseen for longer than man - maybe not without due cause.  An old tale heard from the shadowy bard Lorn whispers that somewhere in the forgotten mountain halls, the One Who Sleeps rests - but surely, that is just a tale. More recently, travelers have reported that a dark power is slowly infiltrating the lands, feeding on the anguish of man and beast alike. The once lively woods are darkening, despite the efforts of the old druid known to call them his home. And what of the strange lights seen on clear nights from the very top of the Sundered Mountain? So far, no one has returned to tell the tale of all these things. Will you?  Lorn, sometimes known as ""the shadowy bard"", is a mysterious being who wanders my lands from time to time. Lately, rumour has it that he needs help with something. Surely, asking him in person would be the best way to find out more about this.
