Command Files
=============
Commands can be placed in files (known as command files).


Reading Command Files
---------------------
Reading and then read into TinTin using two basic methods::

    #class {<classname>} {read} {<filename>}
    #read {filename}

The #class {read} {filename} command is basically shorthand for:

    #class {name} {open};
    #read  {filename};
    #class {close};

Using the #class {read} {filename} method imposes some limitations on us:

1. Everything in the file will be part of the class (we can't mix non-class code in a file read in this way).
2. We don't explicitly remove the existing data before reading it in, therefore unexpected results can occur (if reloading command files on the fly).

I prefer the more flexible approach (using the #read command with explicit #class commands) as described next.


Execution Order
---------------
Command files can load each other. When they do, the command file is immediately read and the commands are immediately executed as soon as #read statement is encountered. The following scripts demonstrate this behavior::

    #nop init.tin;

    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT         Start of init.tin.};

    #alias read {
        #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT:READ    Reading %1.};
        #line verbose #read %1;
    }

    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT         Just before read alias commands.};

    read module1.tin;
    read module2.tin;

    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT         Just after read alias commands.};

    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT         Reading module3.tin started.};
    #read module3.tin;
    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT         Reading module3.tin completed.};


    #nop module1.tin;
    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:MODULE1:     Inside of module1.tin.};

    #nop module2.tin;
    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:MODULE2:     Inside of module2.tin.};

    #nop module3.tin;
    #showme {<fba>DEBUG:MODULE3:     Inside of module3.tin.};

When we execute init.tin with::

    tt++ -v -r init.tin

We see the following output::

    #CONFIG {VERBOSE} HAS BEEN SET TO {ON}.
    #CONFIG {TINTIN CHAR} HAS BEEN SET TO {#}.
    DEBUG:INIT         Start of init.tin.
    #CONFIG {COMMAND ECHO} HAS BEEN SET TO {ON}.
    #CONFIG {VERBOSE} HAS BEEN SET TO {ON}.
    #OK. {reload} NOW ALIASES {#system {tput clear};#kill {all};#read init.tin;} @ {5}.
    #OK. {read} NOW ALIASES {#showme {<fba>DEBUG:INIT:READ    Reading %1.};#line verbose #read %1;} @ {5}.
    DEBUG:INIT         Just before read alias commands.
    DEBUG:INIT:READ    Reading module1.tin.
    #CONFIG {TINTIN CHAR} HAS BEEN SET TO {#}.
    DEBUG:MODULE1: Inside of module1.tin.
    DEBUG:INIT:READ    Reading module2.tin.
    #CONFIG {TINTIN CHAR} HAS BEEN SET TO {#}.
    DEBUG:MODULE2: Inside of module2.tin.
    DEBUG:INIT         Just after read alias commands.
    DEBUG:INIT         Reading module3.tin started.
    #CONFIG {TINTIN CHAR} HAS BEEN SET TO {#}.
    DEBUG:MODULE3: Inside of module3.tin.
    DEBUG:INIT         Reading module3.tin completed.
