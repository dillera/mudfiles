TinTin++
========


Overview
--------
TinTin++ is one of the oldest, most robust mud clients. It's cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux), programmable (impliments it's own scripting engine/language), provides an API for system interaction/integration, runs on the command line (with a curses interface), and is *really* fast (written in Pure C).
