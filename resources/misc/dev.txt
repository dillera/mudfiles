Development Notes
=================

Aliases
-------
### Periods in Names
You can use periods in alias names and things will work as expected:

    #alias {test} {test.help};

Comments
--------
If you don't terminate a #nop statement with a semicolon it will "absorb" the following line:

    #nop I'm just a comment
    #script {
        ....
    }

... in this case breaking the script.


Lists
-----
While you can create associative arrays and you can create multidimensional arrays, they become increasingly difficult to work with:

1. It does not appear possible to search an associative array for an index name, though you can attempt to access it directly.  Without error handling this becomes worthless.
2. The find and foreach commands will not work correctly with multidimensional arrays.

I am not sure how other people maintain large data sets.

Sessions
--------
When creating a new session - the state of the current session (all variables, aliases, classes, etc) are passed into that new session.

These values are separate instances and modifying the value in one session will not modify the value in another.

Strings
-------
When working with strings, quotes sometimes matter. For example:

    #showme "Test";         # yeilds "Test"
    #showme Test;           # yields Test

Variables
---------
### Periods in Names
Periods in variable names are treated as a "list subitem".

    #var {testvar.item} {itemvalue}     #yields: {testvar}={{item}{itemvalue}}
