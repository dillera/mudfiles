These are my old Nanny quest notes that someone sent me, about 20 years ago - literally! Can't believe I was able to find them, but I guess I'd saved some old emails from 1994 and these were in there.

I was able to level up a few times using them, but I wasn't interested in making wizard because I wanted to keep my character a mortal (you automatically make wiz at level 20, or at least you did back then), so I haven't done most of these. YMMV, but hey, they don't take long to try

21 is also reasonably easy to explain. From teh vampire
tower, go s,
buy a dwarvish compassi and 2 torches, then all the way
s,w,s,s to the river.
e to the bridge, s,s to cross it (you need to pay a toll)
then 3w (i think) till it says you can jump the creek. Do
that.
Now you are at the monument. when you enter it and snoop
around, you
break through lots of floors. The master Lich is on the
bottom floor
and the treasure on the second lowest. Once you reach
bottom, go as
far south as possible and wait for an updraught. On the
second lowest
floor, the treasure is far south hidden in a king's and a
queen's
coffin. But, those are watched by quite tough guardian
spirits. You
can't leave the grave easily, so better make sure you got
good armour
etc. When you got all the treasure, simply fall back down
and shake
hands with the master lich!
