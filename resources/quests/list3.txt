Free yourself! (50 points, by Quant)
------------------------------------
It is told that only few people are really free. But you must become one
of them. The only way to do that is by obtaining a special amulet, and use
it to kill the giant demon that prevents people of Nanny from beeing free.
And, as the road to freedom is usually hard and full of unexpected obstacles,
you must be ready to face the powerful forces that keep you from freeing
yourself.
-- Quest description:
  To obtain the wand you must get three parts from the amulet of freedom.
  Ok, at the begining, we'll call ~quant/area/entrance the "starting point".
  Now the parts:
   1. The first part is in the maze, east of the entrance. But, to be able to
     find it, and to get out of the maze, you must use a special clock, owned
     by the guardian, in the portal world (~quant/area/portal/guardian). But
     there's another problem: to get into the portal world (also called the
     spirits world), you must be ghost (there's a portal in ~quant/area/
     monolith/inside/room7 that allows you to pass only as ghost). Now, in
     the spirits world, buy poking around, you can find some gloves, a shield,
     a amulet and a sword. With them, you kill the guardian and get the clock.
     There are more things to be said here:
       a) you can become real in the portal world by shouting a sentence that
          contains the world "real".
       b) you can become ghost by drinking a special potion, that is found at
          one of the monsters in the troll village (~quant/area/village/witch).
       c) the sword has wc 7 (or something like that), but has special attacks
          agains the guardian, that makes it 100++ (approved by Brom).
     This maze is the random part of the quest.
  2. The second part is on the monolith. The only problem is how to get up
    there. If you had looked though the area you must have noticed that in
    ~quant/area/forest/clearing there is an entrance to "past and future". This
    meens that a part of the area exists in three copyes, slightly modified.
    Basicly, the copyed part is ~quant/area/forest = ~quant/area/past = ~quant/
    area/future. So, from somewere in the present forest (~quant/area/forest),
    you get a shovel and some oak seeds. With them, you can go in the past
    world (~quant/area/past/temp2) and "dig" a hole in the ground, "plant" the
    seeds, and water them (there is a water pump in ~quant/area/past/entrance,
    you can "get water" if you have gloves, the water drips, and if you're not
    fast enough, you're out if it when you water the seeds). But ofc., if you
    use too much water, the seeds won't grow (sigh!) (you get a message that
    "The seeds look wet enough to grow.") Ok, lets suppose that the hole was
    digged, seeds planted and watered. In the future (~quant/area/future/temp2)
    a giant oak tree appeared (also appears a "small oak tree" in present,
    ~quant/area/forest/entrance). And you can "climb" the tree and get the
    part from the amulet.
  3. The third part is in the troll village, at the same monster that has
    the ghost potion (~quant/area/village/witch), a kinda tough troll witch.
When you have all the parts, you go to the starting place, and shout something
   that contains the words "create" and "amulet". A small spirit will appear,and
   make an amulet from the items.
With the amulet, you go to the demon that lives up in the monolith and kill
   him. It is VERY tough (thinking of level 10, but 3000hp, ac 20, wc 10, but
   special attacks for 100++ unless you have the amulet ...) Oh, yes, you must
   be saintly to be able to wear the amulet (al > 999)

get sword (you'll be transported)

You will be in a small area shaped like a cross. Kill all the skeletons (2 in each room, 16 in total). When they are all out of your way, pull the levers (located at the end of each corridor). If you pull them in the correct order, the trapdoor will become unlocked. The trapdoor is located at the centre of the area (where you appear when you touch the sword). You can examine locks here to see how many are open. Once you unlock the trapdoor, open it, and go down.

Now wander around the ground and 1st floor of the castle, trying search, move, and look under in all the rooms and corridors (don't need to look in the pub or the room with paragon) until you find a coin (don't forget look under carpet and also to open drawers etc.). Once you get the coin, go back to where you were, and then go w and look for a room which says something like 'One tree looks large compared to the others' in the description.

enter tree, give coin to druid, get shovel, out
Now wander around typing 'dig' (see map below) until you find the anvil of fury. Be careful, you sometimes drop coins into holes, and you can end up losing a lot of cash. Also, you can hurt yourself and lose about 10hp, so keep an eye on that too.

Go back to the entrance of castle:
2s, 2e, n
give anvil to gigel (wait until he makes the holy staff)

d
pick gold, dig tunnel (You won't be able to do this right away, so set an alias, and keep trying until you get xp. Whatever you do, DON'T go up, no matter what those silly messages say)
DONE

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:

If everyone in the party has a pick-axe, they can pick gold and dig tunnel too
and get the qp, which really rocks. After you dig tunnel, you end up in the dragon's den again.
So, if everyone needs a pick-axe, you need to keep going back to the place where you found it,
hoping it has reset so you can get another. In any event, don't kill the dragon, until everyone
has one in their inventory

Free the old Graveyard (95 points, by Krzhugngr)
------------------------------------------------
Note: Bring light

The area is: green: 4w, 12n, nw, 2n, d, 2e, 3n, 6e and then another 2e to get into the graveyard.
>From inside the graveyard: 2n, 3e, 2s, e, n, d

The witch will give you a recipe of things to collect to get her part of the broken key. There are three parts.
out, s, w, 2s, 3w, s and search equipment to get a shovel.  There is a torch here too.
n, e, n,
dig, enter hole. The skeleton will want you to play the skull/pea game. You know, where he puts the pea under the middle skull and then moves them all around and you have to know if the pea is under the left, middle or right skull. Make sure you read SWAP and MOVE, as they have different outcomes. You have 20 seconds to answer, so act fast by typing say left, say middle or say right. If you guess wrong, he kicks you where it hurts, taking 100hp. If you guess right, he drops a bone....get it.
out, 2s,
dig, enter hole and kill ghost (not hard).

>From just inside graveyard, go 2s, 2e, s

s, e, 3s

Jimmy will fix the key and give it to you. The key is an autoloader. If you lose the key, go back to Jimmy and say broken key, and he'll replace it.
Now that you have completed the first part of the quest, put your eq somewhere, as you won't need it until later.
Before going in the well, make sure you have 7k gc, a lantern, a torch and an empty bottle. Read the rest of the catacombs part of the solve now to see what these items are for.
out, 3n, 2w
enter well, light lantern, unlock door with key,
2n
You bump into the door and you get a huggiblu. If the doors reset on you, you can type use huggiblu and be teleported back to this room again, having to start unlocking all the doors again. Hopefully you won't have to use it.
Later you will need an empty bottle (when you examine it it should say it was made by Krzhugngr), so when you see one lying around, pick it up.

exa bulge, open door, buy ticket (2k), exa dealer, buy information (5k)
You will be given a piece of paper, read it: The first part of the name is (write down this word)
2s, w, THERE ARE FOUR LEVERS IN THIS EAST/WEST CORRIDOR. You need to find the configuration of up/down of these 4 levers (based on the previous clue # to open a door, # for a part of the name) and after each attempt, go all e, s, push button. These clues are based on a binary code. Don't fet the combination wrong, different things will happen: a skeleton will jump out, steam will hit you for about 100 hp, sometimes nothing happens, you might be teleported to the zatong monsters (if you go there, swim north to escape)
You need to put the levers into position and go all e, s, and press button. You have to do this twice: once to open the door (You hear a distant rumble) and once for part of the name.
Now to figure out the config for a part of the name, convert the numbers you got into binary, then 1=up and 0=down. So if your numbers were 2 and 8, the binary is 0010 and 1000, so you will set the levers (from left to right) to ddud (then press button) and uddd (then press button)
I hope this makes sense. Write down the part of the name. Once you have finished:
